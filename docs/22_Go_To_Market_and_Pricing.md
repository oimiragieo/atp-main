# Go-To-Market & Pricing Strategy

## 1. ICP & Segments
| Segment | Attributes | Core Need | Deal Size |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| High LLM Spend SaaS | >$250K/yr model spend, multi-provider | Cost control + governance | $50–150K ARR |
| Regulated (Fin/Health/Insurance) | Compliance burden, audit intensity | Policy + privacy + traceability | $120–300K ARR |
| Contact Center / BPO | High volume inference, multilingual | Latency + cost + quality | $80–200K ARR |
| Platform / ML Ops | Central AI enablement team | Consolidation & speed | $40–120K ARR |

## 2. Value Prop by Role
| Role | Pain | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| CTO | Unpredictable AI costs | Predictable spend & savings report |
| CISO | Data leakage risk | PII redaction + DP logs + policy enforcement |
| Head of Product | Slow model experimentation | Built-in champion/challenger workflows |
| FinOps | Limited cost attribution | Per-model/tenant cost telemetry |
| SRE | Latency spikes, outages | SLO burn alerts + auto-throttle + failover |

## 3. Packaging (Draft)
| Tier | Included | Limits | Uplifts |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| Community | Core routing, metrics (7d), basic adapters | 50K req/mo, 1 env | N/A |
| Team | Policy engine, 30d retention, cost dashboard | 5M req/mo, 3 env | $ overages |
| Enterprise | ABAC, DP budgets, federation, 400d retention, SSO/SCIM | Contract commit | Add-on packs |
| Regulated+ | Dedicated VPC/on-prem, HSM/KMS, attestation exports | Contract | Premium support |

## 4. Pricing Mechanics
- Base platform fee per tier + usage (routed request blocks or token normalized units).
- Volume discounts on commit; overage at published rate.
- Add-ons: Marketplace rev-share (70/30), Private model hosting (GPU hr), Compliance pack, Premium Support SLAs.

## 5. Land & Expand Motion
1. Land with cost visibility + quick savings (deploy shadow routing, measure baseline).
2. Expand via governance (policy, privacy) once traffic consolidates.
3. Upsell federation + DP ledger + marketplace for scale/quality optimization.
4. Renew with gain-share ROI report + roadmap alignment session.

## 6. Sales Funnel Assets
- Savings calculator (inputs: current monthly tokens, avg cpt, target QoS) -> projected savings.
- Compliance readiness checklist (maps features to SOC2/GDPR controls).
- Benchmark whitepaper (latency & cost vs single-provider baseline).

## 7. Key Metrics
| Category | Metric | Target Early |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Acquisition | Free->Paid Conversion | 8–12% |
| Adoption | Time to First Production Route | <7 days |
| Value | Savings % Delivered (median) | >15% |
| Retention | Net Revenue Retention | >125% |
| Expansion | Add-on Attach Rate | >35% |
| Efficiency | Gross Margin | >75% |

## 8. Channel & Partners
- Cloud marketplaces (AWS, Azure) for procurement ease.
- Model providers (co-marketing optimized routing for their models).
- Vector DB partners (joint solution briefs).
- Compliance consultancies bundling platform for faster audits.

## 9. Competitive Positioning
"Neutral AI control plane" vs: Prompt tools (lacking governance), Observability-only tools (no routing), Single-vendor gateways (lock-in). Differentiators: integrated compliance primitives, adaptive multi-objective routing, federation, evidence consensus.

## 10. Pilot Framework
| Step | Activity | Success Criteria |
|------|----------|------------------|
| 0 | Baseline capture | Current spend & latency recorded |
| 1 | Shadow routing | Parity latency & quality maintained |
| 2 | Controlled % shift | No regression in SLOs |
| 3 | Savings validation | >10% cost reduction demonstrated |
| 4 | Governance enable | 100% policy coverage |
| 5 | Expansion proposal | ROI deck delivered |

## 11. Renewal / Expansion Playbook
- Quarterly Business Review: savings, quality improvements, incident analysis.
- Present upcoming optimization levers (new adapters, multi-objective model).
- Offer gain-share upgrade if savings > threshold.

## 12. Risk & Objection Handling
| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Adds latency" | Show p95 overhead (<40ms) & savings trade-off; edge nodes roadmap |
| "We can build internally" | Highlight compliance breadth + continuous optimization complexity |
| "Model providers will catch up" | Emphasize neutrality + pluggable ecosystem | 
| "Data security" | Detail redaction, encryption, DP, on-prem option |

## 13. Org & Resourcing (First 12 Mo)
- Founders: Eng (routing/core, security/compliance), GTM (product + sales led).
- Early Hires: Solutions Architect (pilots), DevRel (community growth), FinOps analyst (savings credibility).

## 14. Financial Guardrails
- Target CAC Payback <12 months.
- R&D spend heavy (first 12 mo) then shift to GTM acceleration.
- Infra cost <25% of subscription revenue (optimize GPU pass-through margins).

## 15. Expansion Levers (Year 2+)
- Marketplace scale drives network effects.
- Multi-objective optimizer premium module.
- Regulatory reporting automation (evidence packs) upsell.
- Partner-certified vertical blueprints (healthcare, finance templates).
